# Spring Boot CRUD Application

Welcome to my first CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the following technologies:

- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Maven
- MySQL Database

## Introduction

This project is designed to help me learn and practice building a basic CRUD application using the Spring ecosystem. The application leverages Spring Boot for simplicity and rapid development, Spring MVC for handling web requests, and Spring Data JPA for database interaction with MySQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Framework**: A comprehensive framework for Java development that provides support for building enterprise-level applications.
  
- **Spring Boot**: An extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications with minimal setup.

- **Spring MVC**: A web module of the Spring framework that supports the development of web applications.

- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the larger Spring Data project, it provides a way to interact with databases using Java Persistence API (JPA).

- **Maven**: A build automation and project management tool used for managing dependencies and building Java projects.

- **MySQL Database**: A widely used open-source relational database management system.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-spring-crud-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd your-spring-crud-app
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application.

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
